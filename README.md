## Abstract

This project seeks to explore portfolio building techniques that will do well in bear markets. We look at quarterly and daily data that point to a stock being resistant to recessions, and sample portfolios to compare between resistant and non-resistant stocks. We find that some treatments give promising portfolios during both bull and bear markets. These naive results warrant more investigation into the relationship between these metrics and portfolio performance.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/capstonefiu2020/CAP2020_FINAL/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Goals:
- Build a recession resistant portfolio of S&P 500 stocks that beats the overall market during bear markets while maximizing the Sharpe Ratio
- Establish a proof of concept that will serve as a template for the continuation of building recession resistant portfolios

## Conclusions:
### Experiment 1:
* There was some postive performace 

### Experiment 2:
* The more the Alternative stocks beat the S&P 500 in 8/2008-12/2008, the better the Alternative portfolio performed in Q1 of 2020
* However there was no statistically significant separability between Alternaive and Control portfolios
